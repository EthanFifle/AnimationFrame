1. At least one two-level hierarchical object (e.g. human arm).
    - complete Hand & lamp

2. At least one texture either procedurally generated or mapped.
    - 6 textures in total Metallic, TennisBall, Desk, Knuckles, LampBase, LampLight

3. At least one shader edited or designed from scratch to perform a clearly visible effect.
    - Tint of different objects were applied in the fragment shader. (these are commented in the HTML)
    - A new light source was declared in the vertex shader. (The effect is only noticeable whe the textures are
      not showing. We tried to illuminate the seconds light source with different colours but were not successful.

4. 360 degrees camera fly around using lookAt() and setMV().
    - Used TIME & rotations to achieve this effect, I found the animation easier and the rand of motion to be better/
      more comprehensible so I stuck with this method. (for the camera and all animation)

5. Connection to real-time. You should make sure that your scene runs in real-time on fast enough machines. Real-time
   means that one simulated second corresponds roughly to one real second.
   - complete

6. You should display the frame rate of your program in the console window or the graphics window
   once every 2 seconds.
   - complete

7. Make and submit a movie of your animation. The movie should be about 512x512 and in a standard
   format, such as mp4. Include a cover image (png or jpg) of 100x100 pixels. You may use any screen
   capture program that is available.
   - complete

8. Provide a readme.txt that describes what you have done, what you have omitted, and any other
   information that will help the grader evaluation your work, including what is stated below.
   - The video is slightly different from the finished code as we made one sing edit to it and did not have time
     ro re-record the video. The scene now starts off initially dark and as soon as Toggle Animation is pressed the
     scene lights up display all the textures.
   - This edit was done in lui of not getting the new light source to work properly. Hope it suffices.

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION

9. Complexity: scene setup and design, movement of animated elements, and programming.
   - The majority of the code and functions are commented for understanding. For the purposes of time, the animations
     are hefty copy and past with slight changes in animation. This is ugly code but if I had more time I would fix it.
   - The hand was super complex to animate, like really difficult and took a while.

10. Creativity: story telling, scene design, object appearance and other artistic elements.
    - The scene showed a hand waving hello, playing with a ball and waving good by as if it were trying to entertain the
      user with the object. Playful camera animations help engage the user and leave some curiosity and interpretation up
      to the user.

11. Quality: Attention to detail, modeling quality, rendering quality, motion control.
    - I felt we did and amazing job on the hand, It looks and moves like a real one and the lamp is designed very nice.

12. Programming style.
    - I wish it were better but for the scope of this course and purpose of this assignment I think it meets the necessary
      requirements
